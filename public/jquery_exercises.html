		<dt>What government agency oversees the National Park Service?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>The National Park Service is a bureau of the Department of the Interior. Directly overseeing its operation is the Department's Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.</dd>
		<dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an Act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park. View the National Park System timeline.</dd>
		<dt>What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological values.</dd>
		<dt>How many areas are in the National Park System?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>The system includes 412 areas covering more than 84 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.</dd>

				</ul>
			</dd>
		<dt>How many people visit the national parks?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>Total recreation visitors to the national parks in 2015: 307,247,252</dd>
		<dt>How do I obtain a park pass?</dt>

		<dt>Where can I find a park map?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>You can view maps on specific park websites or download maps from the Harpers Ferry Center map collection.</dd>
		<dt>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check the specific park websites.</dd>
		<dt>What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
			<dd class='invisible'>Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend to visit. In many national parks, off-road driving is illegal. Where off-road driving is allowed, the National Park Service regulates it.
